Incomplete Program:

-Edit so that JSON url doesn't need to be hard coded.                     
-Edit so the JSON attr being fetched doesn't need to be hard coded.

Currently the program requires a hard coded url that connects to a webpage listing JSON objects.
The object attr that is fetched must also be hard coded, as the program currently only returns one 
attr at a time.
